# Neutrino_Simulations_Non-invasive-imaging
Particle Physics Project investigates possible neutrino usage as a method of non-invasive imaging

In the project human_phantom GEANT4 is implemented and used. Also I tried to make my own Neutrino gun and detector to save into root file. Due to no interaction file gets deleted.
